Point System

- Goal of the game is to get 30 points.

Rule 1:

If all players voted for the storyteller’s card or if no player has voted for the storyteller’s card:

- The storyteller does not score points.
- The other players each score 2.


Rule 2:

If some players voted for the storyteller’s card, but not all of them:

- The storyteller scores 3 .
- Players who voted for the storyteller’s card also score 3 .
- The others do not score points.

Rule 3:

In addition, each player (except the storyteller) scores 1 bonus for each vote received on their own card.
