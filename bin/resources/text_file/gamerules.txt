Gameplay

In each round, there is one storyteller assigned. After a round ends, the storyteller will shift to another player. As a storyteller, your job is to pick a card from your hand,
and describe the card with either one word, or a sentence (without showing the card to the other players).

After the storyteller has describe the card that they have chosen, the other players select amongst their 6 cards, the one that best matches the sentence made up by the storyteller.
Then, the selected card will be added to the table card without showing it to the others.

Note: Do not show your hand of cards to anyone.

The goal of the other players is to find which image is from the storyteller amongst the displayed ones. Each player secretly votes for the card that he believes belongs to the storyteller. In the
voting session, the storyteller doesn't get to vote.
